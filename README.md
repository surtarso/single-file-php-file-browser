## Introduction

The **Single File PHP File Browser** is a lightweight and straightforward project that provides a web-based directory listing for the files contained within a specified directory. This project serves as a quick and easy way to share files or documents with others via a web interface. This code provides a flexible way to display and customize directory listings, making it useful for creating file browsers and similar applications.

## Usage

To use the Single File PHP File Browser, follow these simple steps:

**Make sure you have PHP enabled on your webserver.**

1. Download the `index.php` file from this project.

2. Place the `index.php` file in the folder you want to share on the web.

3. Access the folder using a web browser. You can do this by entering the folder's URL in your web browser's address bar. For example, if you placed `index.php` in a folder called "stuff" on your web server, you would access it like this: `http://yourdomain.com/stuff/`.

The `index.php` file will automatically generate a directory listing for the specified folder, allowing you to view and access the contained files and folders via a user-friendly web interface.
## Uploads (Optional)

The upload functionality requires you to add users to the system, but it's entirely optional. Here's how to set it up:

**Enabling Uploads**

1. **Create Users:** The provided script `create-user` will generate a file named `.users` that **must be in the same directory as `index.php` for the upload section to show up.** The `.users` file stores user credentials securely.

   ```bash
   $ create-user your_username your_password
   ```

   This command creates the `.users` file with your credentials, enabling uploads. You can repeat this command to add more users.

2. **Delete Users:** To delete an existing user, run the `create-user` script with the `--delete` flag after the username:

   ```bash
   $ create-user your_username --delete
   ```

   This will remove the user's credentials from the `.users` file. When the last user is deleted, the `.users` file will be automatically removed, and **the upload section will be hidden.**

3. **Upload types:** By default only compressed files are authorized to be uploaded. You can change what types you want by commenting/uncommenting or adding more types to the $allowedUploadTypes global variable at the top of the index.php file:

   ```php
   $allowedUploadTypes = array_merge(
        // array('jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', 'gif', 'webp', 'bmp', 'tiff'),               // images
        // array('mp4', 'mov', 'avi', 'mkv', 'webm', 'flv', 'wmv'),                 // videos
        // array('mp3', 'wav', 'flac', 'ogg', 'aac', 'm4a'),                        // audio
        // array('pdf', 'doc', 'docx', 'xls', 'xlsx', 'ppt', 'pptx', 'txt', 'rtf'), // documents
        array('zip', 'rar', 'tar', 'gz', '7z', '7za'),                           // compressed
        // array('sh'),                                                             // script
        // add more/edit as needed
    );
   ```

**Security Considerations**

- For basic protection, rename the `create-user` script to `.create-user` so it's hidden on the file list (**note: this doesn't hide it completely**). It's better to move it to a location outside the web-accessible directory.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP**: PHP is used to generate the directory listing and handle file system operations.
- **HTML/CSS**: HTML and CSS are used for the presentation and styling of the directory listing.
- **JavaScript:** to implement client-side features.
- **Bash Script:** to provide user management.
- **Font Awesome**: Font Awesome icons are used to enhance the visual representation of files and folders.

## Best Practices

To maintain simplicity and effectiveness, this project follows some best practices:

- **Minimalism**: The code is kept minimal and straightforward to ensure ease of understanding and maintenance.
- **Security**: Security measures are taken by excluding certain file extensions to prevent exposing sensitive files (e.g., PHP files).
- **User Experience**: The interface is designed for user-friendliness, with clear differentiations between files and folders.

## Code Explanation

This PHP code snippet is designed to generate a directory listing for a specified directory, presenting its contents in a structured HTML format. The code can be used to showcase files and subdirectories while allowing for customization of icons based on file extensions. Below is a breakdown of how the code works:

### Function `listDirectory`

```php
function listDirectory($directory) {
    // ...
}
```

- `listDirectory` is a recursive function that takes the path to a directory as its parameter.

### Scanning Directory Contents

```php
$files = scandir($directory);
```

- `scandir` is used to retrieve an array of files and directories within the specified `$directory`.

### Excluded File Extensions

```php
$notAllowedExtensions = array('html', 'php', 'swp', 'css');
```

- An array, `$notAllowedExtensions`, is defined to store file extensions that should be excluded from the listing. These extensions won't be displayed in the directory listing.

### File Extension to Icon Mapping

```php
$iconMapping = array(
    'pdf' => 'fa-regular fa-file-pdf',       // PDF document
    'doc' => 'fa-regular fa-file-word',      // Microsoft Word document
    'docx' => 'fa-regular fa-file-word',     // Microsoft Word document
    'txt' => 'fa-solid fa-file-lines',       // Text document
    'md' => 'fa-solid fa-file-code',         // Markdown document
    'ppt' => 'fa-regular fa-file-powerpoint',// PowerPoint presentation
    // ...
);
```

- `$iconMapping` is an associative array that maps file extensions to corresponding CSS icon classes. These classes determine the icons displayed next to file names in the directory listing.

### Generating the Directory Listing

```php
echo '<ul class="folder-contents">';
foreach ($files as $file) {
    // ...
}
echo '</ul>';
```

- An unordered list (`<ul>`) with the class "folder-contents" is initiated to structure the directory listing.
- A `foreach` loop iterates through the files and directories obtained from `$files`.

### Handling Subdirectories Recursively

```php
if (is_dir($path)) {
    // ...
}
```

- If the current item in the loop is a directory, it is displayed as a folder in the listing. The function `listDirectory` is then called recursively to list the contents of the subdirectory.

### Customizing Icons and File Links

```php
$iconClass = isset($iconMapping[$extension]) ? $iconMapping[$extension] : 'icon-default';
echo '<li><i class="' . $iconClass . '"></i><a href="' . $file . '">' . $file . '</a></li>';
```

- Icons are customized based on file extensions using the `$iconMapping` array. If an extension is not found in the mapping, it defaults to 'icon-default'.
- Hyperlinks are generated for each file or directory entry.

### Specifying the Directory

```php
$directory = './'; // Specify the directory you want to list
```

- The `$directory` variable is set to the path of the directory you want to list.

### Invoking the Function

```php
listDirectory($directory);
```

- Finally, the `listDirectory` function is called with the specified directory to generate the directory listing.
